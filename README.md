### Introduction
The First Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC2017) was a great success co-located with the CCL2017 at Nanjing on October, 2017. The CMRC2017 has attracted lots of attention from the Chinese NLP community. We would like to express our sincere thanks to all the participants and the support from the community.

To further accelerate the progress of Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension field, we are going to organize **The Second Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC2018)** this year, and will be co-located with the CCL2018 at Changsha on October 19 ~ 21.

CMRC2018 is hosted by the **[Technical Committee on Computational Linguistics, Chinese Information Processing Society of China (CIPS-CL)](http://www.cips-cl.org)**, organized by **[Joint Laboratory of HIT and iFLYTEK Research](http://rc.hfl-tek.com)**, sponsored by **[iFLYTEK Co., Ltd.](http://www.iflytek.com)**. We aim to provide a platform for the related researchers and a forum for communications on the related research. Welcome to join us!

**[Joint Laboratory of HIT and iFLYTEK Research（HFL）](http://rc.hfl-tek.com)** is devoting for the development and research on the machine reading comprehension. On Chinese reading comprehension, HFL has released [the first Chinese cloze-style reading comprehension dataset: PD&CFT](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-RC-Dataset). In 2017, HFL has organized [the first evaluation workshop on Chinese machine reading comprehension](https://github.com/ymcui/cmrc2017), which accelerated the research on Chinese reading comprehension. Through annual Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension workshop, we hope the researchers on related field could jointly promote the technical level of Chinese machine reading comprehension.


### Task Description
In the last year, we focus on the **Cloze-style reading comprehension task**, and attracted many participants on evaluation. This year, we will focus on the **Span-Extraction Machine Reading Comprehension**, which is a extension of cloze-style reading comprehension. We have seen many dataset on this kind of reading comprehension, such as SQuAD, NewsQA. However, we did not see there is a Chinese corpus for this purpose. To add diversity in Chinese dataset, we will release the first Chinese Span-Extraction dataset. The participants will analyze the context and query and extract the correct span in the context for answer output.

Following the rule in previous evaluation, we will release training and validation set at first and keep the test set hidden for fairness of the evaluation process.


### Prizes
We will award the top-3 systems as well as the best single model system on our evaluation. The details can be illustrated as follows.

| **Gold Prize** | **￥20,000 + Certificate<sup>*</sup>** |
| :-----: | :-------: |
| **Silver Prize** | **￥10,000 + Certificate** |
| **Bronze Prize** | **￥5,000 + Certificate** |
| **Best Single System Prize** | **￥10,000 + Certificate** |

\*The certificate is provided by **CIPS-CL**


### Important Dates
All the deadlines are Beijing Time (GMT+8) 23:59.

**PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE WEBSITES, IN CASE THERE WILL BE CHANGE IN DEADLINE**
